# Broughlike Js Tutorial

My code along and studies for the BroughLike JS tutorial.

The full and amazing tutorial by Jeremiah Reid (https://twitter.com/trash_impostor) can be found here: https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/stage0.html

The objective of this is trying to keep improving on my basic knowledge of JavaScript and coding in general. Months ago I finished this tutorial, however, I could understand almost zero of all things I typed. Now that I finished an introductory course about JavaScript and one that covered things with a bit more of detail, I decided to come back to it and see how I could understand it.

-- On the second day:
* Amazing to see how an experienced programmer will sew one function into another and build a modular ecosystem.
* Was able to better understand how a 'drawSprite' function can work together with pre-determined values that will define tileSize.
- also learned more about drawImage().
* Could see again objects being acessed and their values being used on what to me looks like a very advanced way of doing things. Yey!
* This time I was able to better understand how each function uses one another since I'm more used to stuff like 'return', accessing information inside objects and Truthy & Falsy in general
